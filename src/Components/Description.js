            <p>Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.

The least little bit can do so much. Use what you see, don't plan it. Every time you practice, you learn more.

Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Fluff that up.

Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. With practice comes confidence. Let that brush dance around there and play. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.

Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. This piece of canvas is your world. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.

I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Just beat the devil out of it. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.
